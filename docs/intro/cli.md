Navify apps are created and developed primarily through the Navify [command-line](../reference/glossary.md#cli) utility. The Navify CLI is the preferred method of installation, as it offers a wide range of dev tools and help options along the way. It is also the main tool through which to run the app and connect it to other services, such as Appflow.

## Install the Navify CLI

Before proceeding, make sure your computer has [Node.js](../reference/glossary.md#node) installed. See [these instructions](environment.md) to set up an environment for Navify.

Install the Navify CLI with npm:

```shell
npm install -g @navify/cli
```

If there was a previous installation of the Navify CLI, it will need to be uninstalled due to a change in package name.

```shell
$ npm uninstall -g navify
$ npm install -g @navify/cli

```

:::note
The `-g` option means _install globally_. When packages are installed globally, `EACCES` permission errors can occur.
Consider setting up npm to operate globally without elevated permissions. See [Resolving Permission Errors](../developing/tips.md#resolving-permission-errors) for more information.

## Start an App

Create an Navify app using one of the pre-made app templates, or a blank one to start fresh. The three most common starters are the `blank` starter, `tabs` starter, and `sidemenu` starter. Get started with the `navify start` command:

```shell
navify start
```

To learn more about starting Navify apps, see the [Starting Guide](../developing/starting.md).

## Run the App

The majority of Navify app development can be spent right in the browser using the `navify serve` command:

```shell
$ cd myApp
$ navify serve
```

There are a number of other ways to run an app, it's recommended to start with this workflow. To develop and test apps on devices and emulators, see the [Running an App Guide](../developing/previewing.md).
