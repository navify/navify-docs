# Data Storage

There are variety of options available for storing data within an Navify app.

Here is an official Navify option:

## @navify/storage

For developers not requiring encryption nor relational data support, [@navify/storage](https://github.com/navify/navify-storage) is an open source key/value API for building apps that work across storage engines on multiple platforms.

Additionally, Navify Secure Storage has a driver that works with the key/value API in `@navify/storage` while providing encryption and SQLite support.
